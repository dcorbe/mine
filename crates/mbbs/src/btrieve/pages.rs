//! The bytes under a Btrieve file: pages, slots, and the file control record.
//!
//! [`records`](super::records) reads a file into memory and knows nothing about
//! where the bytes were. This is the layer that knows: which page a record
//! position lives on, which slot in it, where the next free slot is, and which
//! six fields of the file control record change when a record is written.
//!
//! Everything here is measured off the eighteen files MajorMUD ships rather than
//! taken from a specification, because no specification for the v5 on-disk
//! format survives. Where a field's meaning was settled by comparing several
//! files, the comparison is in the doc comment.
//!
//! # High word first, five times
//!
//! Record pointers, the free-list head, the record count, the total page count,
//! a page's own number and a key's root page are all four-byte quantities stored
//! as two little-endian words with the **high** word first. Reading one as a
//! plain little-endian `u32` yields a plausible wrong number and no error. See
//! [`long`].
