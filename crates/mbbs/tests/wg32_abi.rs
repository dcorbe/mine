//! `Call<Wg32>`, proven against a real `Wg32Cpu` -- in its own process.
//!
//! **Why this is not `crates/mbbs/src/abi/wg32.rs`'s own `#[cfg(test)] mod
//! tests`, unlike every sibling `Abi` file.** A real `Wg32Cpu` needs a real
//! `mbbs_machine::m32::Machine`, and `mbbs_machine::m32::Machine::new` unconditionally registers
//! with `crates/mbbs-machine/src/fault.rs`'s shared arbiter. Registering is no longer
//! destructive to another ABI's recovery -- see below, that is the whole
//! point of the arbiter -- but `cargo test -p mbbs --lib` still runs every
//! 16-bit and 32-bit unit test as threads of ONE process, sharing the one
//! per-thread alternate signal stack and the one process-wide claim
//! registry `crates/mbbs-machine/src/fault.rs` owns. Nothing about that is unsafe by
//! itself, but it is still global state a `Wg32Cpu`-building test has no
//! reason to entangle with `abi/wg32.rs`'s otherwise-pure unit tests, so it
//! stays here, in its own process, on the same reasoning as always.
//!
//! Measured, not assumed: an earlier version of this file's test lived in
//! `abi/wg32.rs` instead, and `cargo test -p mbbs --lib` went from
//! `1281 passed; 0 failed` to `1282 passed; 3 failed` -- three unrelated
//! `mbbs16` fault-recovery tests broke, every one of them because this
//! file's `Wg32Cpu` had already clobbered the process's SIGSEGV handler
//! before they ran. That was `mbbs_machine::m32::fault`'s own standalone handler
//! stealing the disposition `mbbs_machine::m16::fault`'s handler needed, exactly the
//! bug `crates/mbbs-machine/src/fault.rs` now exists to fix -- but `cargo test`'s own
//! process model is still the right isolation for *this* file regardless:
//! each file under `tests/` is a separate binary, hence a separate process,
//! so nothing here needs to depend on the arbiter behaving correctly to stay
//! isolated from unrelated tests.
//!
//! **This no longer describes a production limitation.** A host serving both
//! a 16-bit and a 32-bit module from one process now can: `mbbs_machine::m16::fault` and
//! `mbbs_machine::m32::fault` each register a *positive* claim over the faulting `CS`
//! with `crates/mbbs-machine/src/fault.rs`'s shared arbiter instead of installing a
//! standalone handler, so the second `Machine::new` (whichever ABI is
//! second) no longer steals the first ABI's recovery. See
//! `crates/mbbs/tests/fault_16_after_32.rs`, `fault_16_alone.rs` and
//! `fault_32_after_16.rs` for the constructions this now proves recover
//! correctly in both orders.
