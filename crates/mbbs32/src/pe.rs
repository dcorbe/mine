//! The PE32 loader: a real module, in real sections.
//!
//! Everything about the format is from the PE/COFF specification. Everything
//! about what a *Worldgroup* module actually contains is measured from
//! `re/wg_nt_ref/WCCNT8PJ/out/wccmmud.dll` and recorded in
//! `docs/plans/2026-08-08-mbbs32-design.md`; `re/pefmt.py` reads the import half
//! of the same file and is the cross-check.
//!
//! # Parse, then map
//!
//! Nothing is allocated until the whole file has parsed, so a malformed module
//! is an error rather than a half-built machine.
